# terminal-development
This is a group project to create a flashcard terminology game for 201 students.
Cooperation Plan
Strengths: Nathan backend, roger styling and design, Bishal jscript (-beard script), Michelle front end & organization.
We will allow the team members who are more comfortable with back end pair program with front end team members so that we can all learn from each other and have a strong partner in areas where we feel we need more practice in. Our day to day work will be to meet every morning and talk about what our MVP is for the day and discuss how we plan to accomplish this.
   Conflict Plan
Take a vote
Tie breaker instructor/TA
Be reasonable, and supportive.
Pair program in pairs where one person who is strong and the other who maybe needs more practice work together and vice versa
try to be accountable, and speak up during our meets about how we feel everyone is doing.
reach out to instructor as a team to discuss how to resolve and move forward positively
